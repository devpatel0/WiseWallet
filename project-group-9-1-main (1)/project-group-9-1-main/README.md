Features
Real-Time Financial Tracking
Plaid Integration: Connects directly to Plaid to fetch real-time updates on financial transactions and account balances. This allows users to see up-to-date information about their finances directly from their banking institutions.
Transaction and Budget Management: Users can add and track transactions manually, setting budgets that help manage their spending effectively. The app includes features for planning and comparing expenditures against set budgets.
Investment Tracking
Stock Market Data: Integrates with Rapid API to provide live stock market data, enabling users to follow market trends and manage their stock portfolios directly within the app. This feature is ideal for users who wish to keep a close eye on their investments and make timely financial decisions based on market movements.
Interactive Chatbot
OpenAI-powered Chatbot: Features a conversational chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's technology to answer queries about financial management, transactions, and more. This tool enhances user interaction, providing support and financial advice through an intuitive chat interface.
Account Management
Adding and Deleting Accounts: Users can easily add both manual and Plaid-synced accounts and have the ability to delete them as needed. This flexibility ensures that users can maintain an accurate and up-to-date overview of their financial landscape.
Current Limitations
Category Filter: The category filter for transactions is currently under development and not fully functional. This feature is intended to allow users to filter transactions based on categories such as food, travel, and rent for better financial categorization and analysis. We are actively working to improve this feature and expect to release updates soon.
